					<h2>Project 2: Scalable Icons</h2>
					<p><img src=images/icons.png></p>
					<p>For this project, I chose to create icons of a book, a sunrise over the ocean, and a dog to describe my personality and passions. I chose a book since I love to read and I'm majoring in English, a dog because I have four dogs and deem a dog as my spirit animal, and the image of a sunrise because I am a cheery but also laid-back person. I wanted to keep my icons minimalistic, so I chose to design them as simple as possible so they would scale down nicely.

					<h2>Project 1: Isometric Avatar
					</h2>
					<p><img src=images/avatar.png></p>
					<p>For this project we had to create an isometric avatar of ourselves. I used minimal facial details and added shadows to my clothing to add depth. I included an image of a dog to describe myself because I have four dogs. I chose to only add a nose to the dog to match the small amount of facial features on my avatar. 
					</p>
					<p><img src=images/process.png></p>
					<p> My process for creating the avatar. I thought my original avatar was too flat, so I redesigned it into a more 3-D model while using the same aesthetic elements. Since my new avatar stood at an angle, I had to adjust a few elements. I had to tweak the angle of my sneakers and I added shadows on my clothes.
