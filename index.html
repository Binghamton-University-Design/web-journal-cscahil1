					<h2>Project 3: Article Illustrations</h2>

						<h3> Meat the Family: new reality TV show challenges carnivores to eat their 'pets'</h3>
						<p><img src=images/vegetarian.png></p>
						<p>For this article, I decided to design an image of a woman about to eat a hot dog, only the meat is an actual dachsund. I thought this design represented the message of the article and TV show pretty well since it shows how ridiculous it seems to eat a common household pet. I started by creating an image of a woman's face, a hand, and a hot dog bun in Illustrator. I added details to the face and hand by using the pen and pencil tools and used the free form gradient tool to give the woman's hair some dimension. I thought it would be interesting to give the woman and dog similar hair colors to connect the two as living creatures. Next I cropped an image of a dog in Photoshop and stuck it inside the bun and drew some ketchup on its back. To finish, I placed a photo of flashing camera lights in the background to hint that people do crazy things just for media. </p>

						<h3> Social Media Is Fostering A Big Rise In Real-World Stalking </h3>
						<p><img src=images/stalking.png></p>
						<p> Once I read this article, I immediately knew what I wanted my design to look like. I thought a creepy hooded man looming behind a girl on her phone would represent this article pretty well. I wanted the girl to look like she was completely oblivious to the stalker behind her, so I added Instagram like symbols around her phone to reinforce the idea that younger generations are consumed by social media and technology. I started by creating images of the girl, the like symbols, and the hooded man in Illustrator. I added most details to the objects by using the pen and pencil tools. I then edited a photo of creepy eyes in Photoshop, placed it on the dark area of the hood, and dropped its opactity to give it an eerie look. I finished up by adding texture to the hoodie and placing a photo of a city in the background.

						<h3>Commentary: The sexist demand on female superheroes: Save the world and look hot </h3>
						<p><img src=images/superhero.png></p>
						<p> With this illustration, I contemplated a few designs but ended up putting Wonder Woman on the cover of Playboy to represent the overly sexy portrayal of female superheroes. I thought this was a fun way to illustrate the message of the article while hinting at how superficial media can be. I started by creating images of Wonder Woman, a man's face, a magazine, the Playboy logo, and hands in Illustrator. I added text on the cover of the magazine and used the free form gradient tool to add shadows to the magazine to make it look more realisitc. I added texture to the man's beard to give it more dimension and finished up by added a picture of a bedroom in the background. </p>

					<h2>Project 2: Scalable Icons</h2>
					<p><img src=images/icons.png></p>
					<p>For this project, I chose to create icons of a book, a sunrise over the ocean, and a dog to describe my personality and passions. I chose a book because I love to read and I'm majoring in English, a dog because I have four dogs and deem a dog as my spirit animal, and the image of a sunrise over water because I am a cheery but also laid-back person. I wanted to keep my icons minimalistic, so I chose to design them as simple as possible so they would scale down nicely.  For the colored icons, I chose a pastel color theme and reused the medium blue, dark blue, and yellow throughout each icon. I also decided to use rounded edges on each icon to make them more cohesive. For most icons, I only had to adjust the stroke weight as they got smaller. However, for the smallest dog icon in color, I decided to add a stroke around the dog's face in a darker yellow for more definition. 
					</p>
					<p><img src=images/process2.png></p>
					<p> I brainstormed a few different options for each logo. As I looked at my sketches and drafts, I decided to make my icons flat with minimal detail. Although my icons were simple, I tried to make them more interesting by adding a second layer to the book, combining my ideas of the sun and water for the sunrise icon, and doing a close up of a dog's face instead of a silhouette.

					<h2>Project 1: Isometric Avatar
					</h2>
					<p><img src=images/avatar.png></p>
					<p>For this project we had to create an isometric avatar of ourselves. I used minimal facial details and added shadows to my clothing to add depth. I included an image of a dog to describe myself because I have four dogs. I chose to only add a nose to the dog to match the small amount of facial features on my avatar. 
					</p>
					<p><img src=images/process.png></p>
					<p> My process for creating the avatar. I thought my original avatar was too flat, so I redesigned it into a more 3-D model while using the same aesthetic elements. Since my new avatar stood at an angle, I had to adjust a few elements. I had to tweak the angle of my sneakers and I added shadows on my clothes.
